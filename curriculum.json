Either one will give you an introduction to programming that assumes no prior knowledge.\nTrying to decide between them?\n_Python for Everyone_ will introduce you to a popular language and will quickly move to practical programming tasks - using web APIs and databases. This will give you a taste of what many professional developers do.\n_Fundamentals of Computing will also start by introducing you to Python. It then moves on to give an introduction to academic Computer Science topics, like sorting and recursion. This will give you a taste of what the following courses will be like. (Students who complete Fundamentals of Computing can skip Intro to Computer Science and begin Core CS.)_",

Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken. But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.\nThe Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications). A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course. If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.",
